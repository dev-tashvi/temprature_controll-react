# Temperature Control React Project with Vite

This is a simple React project created using Vite that allows you to control and visualize temperature changes. It demonstrates the use of `useState` to manage temperature state and dynamically change the background color based on the temperature value.

## Features

- Increase or decrease the temperature by clicking on buttons.
- Background color changes according to the temperature range:
  - Cold (Below 15째C): Blue background
  - Normal (15째C - 30째C): Green background
  - Hot (Above 30째C): Red background

## Technologies Used

- React
- JSX
- CSS
- Vite
